Make the game more realistic:
- Have dues:
    - Example: Pay a random amount of money every time the player purchases a upgrade

Problem:

    We get a special message triggered by the amount of money you have, like "You found some friends";
    When we purchase a upgrade, and our money decreases, the message changes because of the if statements 
    causing them in the first place. It doesn't make sense to have found friends, lost friends and gained 
    them again in such a short period of time.

    Solution(s):
        One way to fix this problem is to make the messages dependent not on the amount of money you have, 
        but instead the amount of upgrades you have.

        The second way to fix this problem is to have a numeric value that corresponds to the statement, 
        then at the beginning of each if statement, you check that numeric value and determine if you should
        continue with the changing of the statement

        I personally like the second method a lot more, because I think it wouldn't look as good if you had two 
        text values on a page updating at the same time.

    Fixed!!!

Problem:
    When we are going through the game, if you don't buy the first upgrade and wait until you can afford the 
    second upgrade, the game keeps the first upgrade, but the other upgrades you get after it are forgotten.

    Solution(s):
        One way to fix this problem is to, whenever a upgrade is purchased, go through the upgrade if
        statements again and check if any of them are true.

    Fixed!!!


    Ronins Criticism:

    * needs more upgrades
        * they don't even need words
    * rebirth doesn't make sense add more money
